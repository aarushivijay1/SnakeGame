# SnakeGame

This game is a peek into our childhood -  the first game we ever played was the "Snake"

## About the Game
Some simple rules of the game to help you understand it better:

- Don't run the snake into the wall, or his own tail: you will die.

- Use your cursor keys: up, left, right, and down.

- Eat the red apple to gain points (points increase by 10).
