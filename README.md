# SnakeGame

SnakeGame is a peek into the classic "Snake" game that we all were addicted to in our childhood! This version of the game has been created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Feel free to play or build on!

## About the Game

Help the snake on the screen by eating all the food possible. The location of the food keeps changing and you need to trace the food as it moves. Keep in mind that if you run into the walls or the snake's own tail, you will die.


Some simple rules of the game to help you understand it better:

- Don't run the snake into the wall, or his own tail: you will die.

- Use your cursor keys: up, left, right, and down.

- Eat the red apple to gain points (points increase by 10).

## How to Play


- Download the github files on your desktop

- Open the index.html file in the browser.
